## Workflow

See images

```bash
npx create-react-app client
```

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .
Sending build context to Docker daemon    178MB
...
Successfully built e60c8b0483b7
```

The create-react-app command downloads all dependecies to the `node+modules` folder. When we build the app npm run install downloads loads more dependencies.

Therefore, we can delete `node modules` folder.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 e60c8b0483b7
```

To enable changes to the files as we develop to be pushed automatically into the docker container without stopping, rebuilding the image and restarting the container!

Docker volumes set up a reference that the docker container can use that points to our local folders that DO change as we develop.

On windows add the following file to root directory `.env` with the line `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`.
